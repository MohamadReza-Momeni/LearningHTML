    <p>Development of <i>Silent Hill 2</i> began in June 1999, soon after <i><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Hill_(video_game)" title="Silent Hill (video game)">Silent
                Hill</a></i> had been completed. Its narrative was inspired by the Russian novel <i><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_and_Punishment" title="Crime and Punishment">Crime and
                Punishment</a></i> (1866) by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoevsky"
            title="Fyodor Dostoevsky">Fyodor Dostoevsky</a>, and some of the influences on the game's artistic style
        include the work of film director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lynch" title="David Lynch">David
            Lynch</a> and paintings by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon_(artist)"

            title="Andrew Wyeth">Andrew Wyeth</a>; cultural references to history, films and literature can be found in
        the game. In contrast with the previous title, whose narrative concerned cult activity, <i>Silent Hill 2</i>
        focuses directly on the psychology of its characters.</p>

    <p>In North America, Japan, and Europe, over one million copies of <i>Silent Hill 2</i> were sold, with the greatest
        number of sales in North America. Critics praised its <a
